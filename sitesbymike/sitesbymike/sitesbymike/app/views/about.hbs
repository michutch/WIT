  <p>At a time when certain job professions are withering away at the hands of technology and automation, 
    there's one skill set that continues to be more in demand than ever before: coding.

  <p>Organizations are constantly looking for website developers,
      and computer programmers. 
      If you understand how to code and prove to be knowledgeable,
      you shouldn't have any trouble finding high paying jobs that are flexible and enjoyable.
      </p>
  <p>The trouble is that coding isn't easy. 
      It takes a lot of time, and dedication to understand the basics of coding. 
      It's like learning a new language, which takes a lot of time and effort. However, once you've successfully learned a second language, 
      you can generally learn a third and fourth without much trouble.
